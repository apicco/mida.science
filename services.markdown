[MIDA.science](/) offers comprehensive assistance in all the technical aspects required for microscopy experiments and image and data analysis, and helps you find the optimal balance between them to fully unleash the potential of your quantitative microscopy experiments.
Read about my [Microscopy](#microscopy), [Image Analysis](#image-analysis), and [Data Analysis](#data-analysis) services.

# Microscopy

I excel in fluorescence microscopy techniques, from confocal to wide-field microscopy, with a particular emphasis on quantitative methods such as localization microscopy, FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) microscopy, TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy, differential evanescence field nanometry ([Merrifield, *et al.*, 2002][merrifield-2002]; [Merrifield, *et al.*, 2005][merrifield-2005], [Saffarian, *et al.*, 2008][saffarian]), 
and microscopy automation and computer vision for high throughput of rare events.
I can assist you with everything from the planning of such experiments, such as sample preparation and genomic engineering or the optimization of the microscope light path, to the development of dedicated software or the execution of the imaging itself.

|*Differential evanescence field imaging of endocytosis in baker yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In <span style="color:green">green</span> is an endocytic coat marker, Sla1, tagger with EGFP. In <span style="color:magenta">magenta</span> Â is an actin crosslinker, Sac6, tagged with mCherry. From left to right: bright field image, wide-field movie (WF), and TIRF movies on the green and red channels. I acquired the two TIRF images simultaneously with a Hamamatsu Gemini beam splitter. Measuring the beginning of the coat internalisation is possible by comparing the time a green spot disappears in the TIRF movie to the WF movie. Movie plays 7x faster.*|

# Image Analysis

I can assist you in choosing, adapting, or developing image analysis solutions that best suit your experiment goals. Moreover, Image analysis is not a magic tool that outputs quantitative information from any image. It is intimately linked to the imaging process. My experience with microscopy will help you optimize the planning of your imaging experiment to maximize the quality of the image analysis quantitative output.

|*Centroid tracking of an endocytic coat marker (Sla1) tagged with EGFP and imaged as a diffraction limited spot in wide-field microscopy. Sla1 dynamic acts as a proxy for the endocytic invagination growth. The CLEM image on the right shows a mature endocytic invagination for comparison. Scale bar is 100 &mu;m and applies to both images.*|

# Data Analysis

I have extensive experience in data analysis and statistics solutions to interpret measurements. The data analysis one can do is intimately linked to the quality of the quantitative experiment, such as the noise of the measurements or the possible systematic errors, and its goals, such as the significance aimed at. I will also help you optimize the data analysis by carefully planning the imaging experiment and its image analysis.

|*Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of the probability distribution *p* describing the separation of centroid positions of diffraction limited objects imaged by fluorescence microscopy ([Churchmann, et al., 2006][churchmann]). This MLE was used to determine the true separation &mu; between proximal fluorophores. The MLE was computed on the coreset (red histogram) of the original dataset (grey histogram) to estimate the separation between distinct fluorophores imaged in close proximity.
