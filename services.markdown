At [MIDA.science](/),Â we offer comprehensive assistance in all the technical aspects required for quantitative microscopy experiments and data analysis. We can guide you in any of the three aspects listed below, or better yet, help you find the optimal balance between them to fully unleash the potential of your quantitative microscopy experiments.

**Microscopy**

We excel in all the fluorescence microscopy techniques, from confocal to wide-field microscopy, with a particular emphasis on quantitative methods such as localization microscopy, FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching) microscopy, TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy, differential evanescence field nanometry ([Merrifield, *et al.*, 2002][merrifield-2002]; [Merrifield, *et al.*, 2005][merrifield-2005], [Saffarian, *et al.*, 2008][saffarian]), 
and microscopy automation and computer vision for high throughput of rare events.
We can assist you with everything from the planning of such experiments, such as sample preparation and genomic engineering or the optimization of the microscope light path, to the development of dedicated software or the execution of the imaging itself.

**Image Analysis**

We can assist you in choosing, adapting, or developing image analysis solutions that best suit your experiment goals. Moreover, Image analysis is not a magic tool that outputs quantitative information from any image. It is intimately linked to the imaging process. Our experience with microscopy will help you optimize the planning of your imaging experiment to maximize the quality of the image analysis quantitative output.

**Data Analysis**

We provide an extensive experience in data analysis and statistics solutions to interpret measurements. Again, planning your experiment influences the data analysis you can do, the noise of the measurements, the significance you can aim for, and the possible systematic errors. All of these can be optimized with careful planning of the imaging experiment and with a proper choice of the number of data points you will need to acquire to perform your analysis.
