title:  "The stoichiometry of the ERMES complex"

The endoplasmic reticulumâ€“mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) tethers the endoplasmatic reticulum and mitochondria. It is a four-subunit complex whose stoichiometry and architecture were unknown. 

Wide-filed microscopy images show subunits of the ERMES complex, tagged with EGFP as puncta. Spotquant, a tool for quantitative analysis, compared the brightness of these puncta with the kinetochore structures, whose stoichiometry is known. These structures acted as fiducials, calibrating the fluorescence intensity of the ERMES to measure the number of molecules.

The integration of the stoichiometry of the ERMES complex with cryo-correlative microscopy, subtomogram averaging and molecular modelling helped resolve the ERMES complex's architecture with unprecedented detail.
